# algorithm
This repository contains the algorithms in Kotlin language

    1. Palindrome
    2. LinkedList
    3. Array
    4. Matrix related
    5. Tree related
    6. String reversal and anagrams solution

    This is work in progress, 
        1. Idea is to cover atleast one algirthm for each type of problem
        2. Also try to cover using 360 degree aproach
            1. What I mean is that if Tree travesal can be achived using the recurresion, stack and queue then cover all three types to have the understanding of all three for easy reveiw when needed.
